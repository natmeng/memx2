If the Bletchley Park codebreakers could work out the daily key, they could decrypt and read all of the intercepted German messages sent that day. This was done using replica Enigma machines, manufactured in Britain. But the number of possible daily keys was almost too big to imagine. In the case of the German army and air force Enigma, there were 158.9 million, million, million possibilities. It was this daily key that Turing and his colleagues were trying to work out. \u2014 Updated on 2023-03-06 14:45:13 \u2014 Group: #Public</p> <ul> <li>Annotation: the original goal of turings team was to go through the millions of possible keys in order to attempt to find the proper key</li> </ul> </li> <li>At Bletchley Park, Turing devised a new and more powerful kind of electro-mechanical machine for determining the crucial Enigma settings. Another Cambridge mathematician working at Bletchley Park, Gordon Welchman, made a crucial addition that increased the effectiveness of the machine \u2013 called the Bombe \u2013 providing Bletchley Park with a vital codebreaking tool. \u2014 Updated on 2023-03-06 14:45:46 \u2014 Group: #Public<ul> <li>Annotation: Bombe, was the machine used to break enigma</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Bombe, though, wasn\u2019t the complete solution to Enigma.
