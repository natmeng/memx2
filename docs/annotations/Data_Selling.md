## Highlights
- Among other stipulations, the CCPA requires businesses to inform consumers regarding the types of personal data they’ll collect at the time they collect it and also how the information will be used. Consumers have the right to ask firms to disclose with whom they share the data and also opt out of their data being sold. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:53:11](https://hyp.is/Da2cyLx6Ee24H4cgRhh7vQ/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Consumers finally getting informed on what data of theirs is being shared
- According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 107 countries have data privacy rules in place including 66 developing nations. In the U.S., there was a “significant” increase in data privacy bills being introduced this year, with at least 25 states and Puerto Rico starting such legislation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Notably, this bill count doesn’t include related legislation on topics such as cybersecurity. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:54:03](https://hyp.is/LEFn8Lx6Ee2tTHdz-IMyTA/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: More than half of the countries in the UN already have data privacy rules in existence
- In part to head off more stringent laws, companies and computer scientists are collaborating to provide computational and business solutions to strengthen data protections while not hampering innovation and operational efficiency. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and others have come forward with changes that give users more control over how they are being tracked and how their data is being used. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:54:43](https://hyp.is/RCBsDrx6Ee2_FCNJgdvXvQ/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: A compromise between user and company on data control
- Some recent changes include the following: Google users can now choose to opt in to save their audio data collected by Google Assistant, which uses it to better recognize their voices over time. They can also delete their interactions at any time and agree to a human reviewer of the audio. This month, Facebook’s Instagram rolled out a new feature that lets users manage which third-party apps have access to their data — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:55:18](https://hyp.is/WTy8ALx6Ee2qIEvzUxZY4Q/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Some examples of ways consumers are given more power over their data
- Every time you interact with the company, you should expect that the company is recording that information and connecting it to you.” — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:55:53](https://hyp.is/bgmL1rx6Ee2XoRfFC6sAww/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: A look into how often your data is being collected
- For example, a business that knows you’re a pet owner based on your searches for cat food could send you coupons. Companies can also use your data to improve product designs and performance — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:56:17](https://hyp.is/fISedrx6Ee24XRst_U4svA/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Not all uses of data are for malicious purposes
- The most common way a user is tracked is through the placement of ‘cookies,’ or files that a website or web service places in your device. So when you return to the website, you don’t have to re-enter your password to log on, for example, because you’re recognized, according to Sebastian Angel, professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s for convenience,” he says. “But because they’re putting these cookies in your devices, it now allows, [say,] Facebook to know where you’re going on the internet.” — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:57:53](https://hyp.is/tVevcrx6Ee2DOz-hEa_hDg/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: cookies are a hidden way in which you can be tracked
- Last semester, Angel taught a computer science course on how to build tools for anonymity and privacy. One idea was to build a version of Netflix that would shield your movie choices from the company and yet gives you access to the full roster of content. “We can build it,” he says. “It’s technologically feasible” to find a way to stream it to millions or billions of people. But such a system would be costly. For example, if Netflix needed 10,000 computers in their data center to serve movies to everyone, under Angel’s version, it might need 10 times more, or 100,000. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:59:24](https://hyp.is/68jNerx6Ee2gGV_gl6lyXw/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/) — Group: #Public
