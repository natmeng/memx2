## Page Notes
## Highlights
- One such story came to light with the release of the 2016 book Hidden Figures and the film of the same name. It’s the story of Black women who worked at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the South—specifically, in Hampton, Virginia. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 17:44:39](https://hyp.is/O0n2BtTEEe25jgt3UAhD0g/education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/nasas-west-area-computers/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: This story was used to create hidden figures
- Though computers were paid far more than most jobs available to women at the time, they were paid less than men with similar qualifications. To add further insult, the women were classified as “subprofessionals,” while men were termed “professionals.” — [Updated on 2023-04-06 17:46:57](https://hyp.is/jglxMtTEEe2zqZe1GHMvdg/education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/nasas-west-area-computers/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Segregation and discrimination still at large
- The reason Blacks were able to be hired as computers was because of an executive order banning racial discrimination in hiring for federal work. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in 1941 to stop Black civil rights activist A. Philip Randolph from organizing a march on Washington, D.C., to protest racial discrimination. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 17:48:27](https://hyp.is/w2mbLNTEEe2molsc3O-frA/education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/nasas-west-area-computers/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: it was a battle just to even get considered for a position as a black woman
- Two years after starting in the West Area Computing Unit in 1951, Mary Jackson took another position researching supersonic flight as a mathematician. She received special permission to take engineering classes at a white facility, becoming NASA’s first Black engineer in 1958. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 17:49:12](https://hyp.is/3mTyyNTEEe29fLtrbQQ2SQ/education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/nasas-west-area-computers/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Became first black engineer
- The West Area Computers endured the racism of a segregated workplace and the casual sexism apparent when these grown, professional women are referred to with terms like “girl.” Nevertheless, they persisted, demanding equity and recognition. They actively fought back in ways both big and small. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 17:49:30](https://hyp.is/6MHvFNTEEe2VHhu-JAEuEg/education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/nasas-west-area-computers/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Acts of segregatino and discrimination
