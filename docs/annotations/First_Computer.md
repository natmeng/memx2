## Page Notes
## Highlights
- *the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer, built during World War II by the United States.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:10](https://hyp.is/ebBxGKjIEe2ZDZOOQnLTiQ/www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Created for military use, which is a common theme
- *ENIAC was enormous. It occupied the 50-by-30-foot (15-by-9-metre) basement of the Moore School, where its 40 panels were arranged, U-shaped, along three walls. Each panel was about 2 feet wide by 2 feet deep by 8 feet high (0.6 metre by 0.6 metre by 2.4 metres). With more than 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays, it was easily the most complex electronic system theretofore built. ENIAC ran continuously (in part to extend tube life), generating 174 kilowatts of heat and thus requiring its own air conditioning system.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:23](https://hyp.is/gYKAwKjIEe21-BONnB5H6Q/www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows har large computers are compared to today, where our iphones have thousands of times more processing power and capability than the ENIAC
- *The disadvantage was that it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem. This was such a liability that only with some generosity could it be called programmable.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:25](https://hyp.is/gsFcaKjIEe2a7wewoiKhzw/www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: It was very fast at computing, but the only drawback was the time needed to reprogram it to complete a new task
- *Designed specifically for computing values for artillery range tables, it lacked some features that would have made it a more generally useful machine.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:28](https://hyp.is/hD8oBKjIEe21-gsW1IFL0Q/www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: original design was for a specific function, but later evolved once seeing how it performed
