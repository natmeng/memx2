## Page Notes
## Highlights
- *But the final steps were always performed manually: the job of the Bombe was merely to reduce the number of combinations that the cryptanalysts had to examine.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:38](https://hyp.is/rdWFZKjIEe2547v20w1IjQ/www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: The first version of the bombe still needed human imput for the final steps in order to fully break enigma
- . *Eventually, the Enigma was superseded by the Lorenz. These required yet more codebreaking in Britain, and more automation to do it – leading to the production of Colossus, the world’s first digital programmable computer.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:39](https://hyp.is/rnF35KjIEe2dmisqtu8-PQ/www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: The work on the bombe to break enigma led directly to the creation of the worlds first digital programmable computer
- *Leading to more than 17,000 different combinations before the encryption process repeats itself. Adding to the scrambling was a plugboard, sitting between the main rotors and the input and output, which swapped pairs of letters. In the earliest machines, up to six pairs could be swapped in that way; later models pushed it to 10, and added a fourth rotor.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:40](https://hyp.is/r0anrKjIEe21_S96n8a38w/www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows how efficient the machine was to deciphering code vs the human brain, as 17,000 combinations done by a human would take and exponentially longer amount of time
- *But that reflector also led to the flaw in Enigma, and the basis on which all codebreaking efforts were founded: no letter would ever be encoded as itself. With that knowledge, as well as an educated guess at what might be encrypted in some of the messages (common phrases included “Keine besonderen Ereignisse”, or “nothing to report” and “An die Gruppe”, or “to the group”), it was possible to eliminate thousands of potential rotor positions.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:41](https://hyp.is/r_3sAKjIEe2HDd-ZmXYOTA/www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: This factor is a major reason why the british were able to break enigma
- *Like all the best cryptography, the Enigma machine is simple to describe, but infuriating to break* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:43](https://hyp.is/sQQ3TqjIEe2-b1-RUePNhg/www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows how cryptography is so simple, yet so effective from the opening statement

- *The board lights up to show the encrypted output, and the first of the three rotors clicks round one position – changing the output even if the second letter input is the same as the first one.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:44](https://hyp.is/sZefSKjIEe27XzNsPgy1yQ/www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: This is an example of the physical work that computers once did that is now doin fully within the software.
