## Page Notes
## Highlights
- *So intact, in fact, that they could travel another 3,000 miles to a computer in Boston and be reassembled into exactly the same message that was typed into the terminal at Rossotti’s. Powering this internetwork odyssey was the new protocol cooked up by Kahn and Cerf. Two networks had become one. The internet worked.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:40](https://hyp.is/i40WmKjIEe2u6zdsZnIg-g/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: kind of similar to decoding plaintext into cipher text with encryption, then back to plaintext
- *The people who invented the internet came from all over the world.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:42](https://hyp.is/jJksmKjIEe2dW3P_Nz43yQ/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows how although, this group is getting credit, it was a process that spanned continents and hundreds of people 
- *As a military venture, Arpa had a specifically military motivation for creating the internet: it offered a way to bring computing to the front lines. In 1969, Arpa had built a computer network called Arpanet, which linked mainframes at universities, government agencies, and defense contractors around the country. Arpanet grew fast, and included nearly 60 nodes by the mid-1970s.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:43](https://hyp.is/jTh0pqjIEe2dmIOtpIeumw/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Originally created for military use
- *The internet would end up being useful to the US military, if not quite in the ways its architects intended. But it didn’t really take off until it became civilianized and commercialized – a phenomenon that the Arpa researchers of the 1970s could never have anticipated.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:44](https://hyp.is/jgwLmqjIEe2tE8P-agls5w/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Even after creating the internet, its creators did not see a future of it being used for anything other than the military
- *But Arpanet had a problem: it wasn’t mobile. The computers on Arpanet were gigantic by today’s standards, and they communicated over fixed links. That might work for researchers, who could sit at a terminal in Cambridge or Menlo Park – but it did little for soldiers deployed deep in enemy territory. For Arpanet to be useful to forces in the field, it had to be accessible anywhere in the world.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:45](https://hyp.is/jsRu2KjIEe2B628nWRPEeg/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: The issue that arose for the solution of the internet to be invented
- *Making this dream a reality required doing two things. The first was building a wireless network that could relay packets of data among the widely dispersed cogs of the US military machine by radio or satellite. The second was connecting those wireless networks to the wired network of Arpanet, so that multimillion-dollar mainframes could serve soldiers in combat. “Internetworking,” the scientists called it.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:46](https://hyp.is/j1t2FqjIEe25nnPhzhhGRQ/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Even when creating it, its main goal was for military use
- *Trying to move data from one to another was like writing a letter in Mandarin to someone who only knows Hungarian and hoping to be understood. It didn’t work.In response, the architects of the internet developed a kind of digital Esperanto: a common language that enabled data to travel across any network.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:48](https://hyp.is/kI6rFqjIEe28v1-8zFK-ZA/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: A key breakthrough which allowed any 2 computers or networks to communicate with each other
- *There was nothing inevitable about the internet getting built. It seemed like a ludicrous idea to many, even among those who were building it. The scale, the ambition – the internet was a skyscraper and nobody had ever seen anything more than a few stories tall. Even with a firehose of cold war military cash behind it, the internet looked like a long shot.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:24:50](https://hyp.is/kbfM6KjIEe22fq8J4ueMSg/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows how large and hard the invention of the "internet" as a concept was
