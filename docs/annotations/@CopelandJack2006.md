## Page Notes
## Highlights
- A paper by Turing is published that is later recognised as laying the foundation of computer science — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:42:38](https://hyp.is/DQ9IXLxXEe2_oe-uATEeWg/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Publishes a fundamental paper on computer science at the age of 25

- . The man was Alan Turing, and his work at nearby Bletchley Park – the secret base of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:43:40](https://hyp.is/MjlnUrxXEe2t7Deicndugg/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: This team was in charge of breaking the german enigma code
- Contrary to popular belief, there was no single ‘Enigma code’. The Enigma machine – actually a family of portable encryption devices that substituted each letter of a message for another letter of the alphabet – was first developed in the 1920s and enhanced over subsequent years. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:44:19](https://hyp.is/SRtCsLxXEe2ubAsmcobu6Q/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Mentioned in Enigma article covered in first memex check in

- The setting that governed these substitutions was known at Bletchley Park as the daily key, because it was usually changed every 24 hours. If the Bletchley Park codebreakers could work out the daily key, they could decrypt and read all of the intercepted German messages sent that day. This was done using replica Enigma machines, manufactured in Britain. But the number of possible daily keys was almost too big to imagine. In the case of the German army and air force Enigma, there were 158.9 million, million, million possibilities. It was this daily key that Turing and his colleagues were trying to work out. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:45:13](https://hyp.is/aXnjGLxXEe2m6Uv2d7PbKw/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: the original goal of turings team was to go through the millions of possible keys in order to attempt to find the proper key
- At Bletchley Park, Turing devised a new and more powerful kind of electro-mechanical machine for determining the crucial Enigma settings. Another Cambridge mathematician working at Bletchley Park, Gordon Welchman, made a crucial addition that increased the effectiveness of the machine – called the Bombe – providing Bletchley Park with a vital codebreaking tool. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:45:46](https://hyp.is/fWC_oLxXEe22Oq-AX1wQlg/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Bombe, was the machine used to break enigma
- The Bombe, though, wasn’t the complete solution to Enigma. Early in 1940, Turing was asked to take on the task of breaking the German navy’s Enigma system, which used more secure procedures than those of the air force and army. Many at Bletchley believed it could not be broken — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:46:10](https://hyp.is/i1SG-rxXEe2qQtN6jUyCjw/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Turing is given an even more insurmountable task
- , Turing managed to deduce, quite quickly, how these code books were being used, but realised that his team would need to acquire copies before further progress could be made.It wasn’t till a German naval code book was captured that Turing and his colleagues began to achieve success in working out the daily key and reading encrypted German naval messages. Intelligence reports about Germany’s U-boat and ship movements could then be produced and sent to the Admiralty for dissemination — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:46:44](https://hyp.is/n6xVOLxXEe23hZ9M4UkVXg/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: The key turning point in breaking the naval codes
- Years later, Bletchley Park codebreaker Peter Hilton explained that what set Turing apart from his colleagues was his ability to come up with ideas that Hilton felt he would not have thought of “in a million years” — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:47:10](https://hyp.is/r1djBrxXEe2X4R_Prz2JKg/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows how truly brilliant Mr.Turing was
- But while Turing’s academic renown was growing, his private life was in turmoil. On 31 March 1952 at a court in Knutsford, Cheshire, Turing was charged with being “party to the commission of an act of gross indecency” – in effect, he was charged with being homosexual. He pleaded guilty. Instead of imprisonment he opted for hormone ‘treatment’ – oestrogen injections that made him put on weight and enlarged his breasts. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:48:06](https://hyp.is/0LQ-orxXEe2CQjfUJiuNSA/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Even though he had saved millions of lives, he was still punished for his sexuality when it became known to the public eye
- On the morning of 8 June 1954, Turing was found dead in bed by his housekeeper. The coroner’s verdict found that he had taken his own life; there were reports that a partly eaten apple by his bed contained traces of cyanide. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:49:40](https://hyp.is/CLgOgrxYEe2IbhsEromzvQ/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: He chose to end his own life due to the assault and belittlement and disrespect that was shown upon him which prematurely ended the life of one of the founding fathers of computer science today
