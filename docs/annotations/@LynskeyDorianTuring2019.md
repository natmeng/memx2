## Page Notes
## Highlights
- It appeared to be regurgitating requests to book train tickets for journeys he had already taken and to record TV shows that he had already watched. Josephson had not said the wake word – “Alexa” – to activate it and nothing he said would stop it. It was, he says, “Kafkaesque”. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:26:03](https://hyp.is/QxCgbLx2Ee2KcvOd96zMZg/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: A precursor to the rest of the article subject
- This was especially interesting because Josephson (not his real name) was a former Amazon employee. Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:26:47](https://hyp.is/XSK0kLx2Ee2qBvcINiz2tg/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: He himself worked at amazon
- When the Dot’s outburst subsided, he unplugged it and deposited it in the bin. “I felt a bit foolish,” he says. “Having worked at Amazon, and having seen how they used people’s data, I knew I couldn’t trust them.” — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:27:12](https://hyp.is/bCXZIrx2Ee2XhR-3s1rpBA/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: As a former amazon worker, he knew he couldn't trust them
- Last year, an Amazon customer in Germany was mistakenly sent about 1,700 audio files from someone else’s Echo, providing enough information to name and locate the unfortunate user and his girlfriend. (Amazon attributed this “unfortunate mishap” to human error.) — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:27:56](https://hyp.is/hl_vJrx2Ee2vJ__rNeTj9Q/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Another strange occurrence of Alexa going 'rogue'
- In a statement, Amazon said that the Echo must have misheard the wake word, misheard a request to send a message, misheard a name in its contacts list and then misheard a confirmation to send the message, all during a conversation about hardwood floors. Not great, Alexa. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:28:39](https://hyp.is/oBNC7Lx2Ee2uOrddKLDZdg/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Clearly these are very weak excuses that Amazon gives for these strange occurances
- This year has been particularly tricky. Over the past six months, Bloomberg, the Guardian, Vice News and the Belgian news channel VRT have gradually revealed that all the big five have been using human contractors to analyse a small percentage of voice-assistant recordings. Although the recordings are anonymised, they often contain enough information to identify or embarrass the user – particularly — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:30:15](https://hyp.is/2P6ZHLx2Ee2ak-dgi1eb-w/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Even anonymous voice-assistant recordings can be used to identify the user
- His own Echo would wake up unprompted. Recordings began showing up as evidence in court cases. The FBI refused to confirm or deny that it was using Alexa for surveillance purposes. “It became increasingly clear to me that the privacy watchdogs were right,” he says. “It is, at base, a wiretapping device.” — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:31:14](https://hyp.is/_Few2Lx2Ee2uyZefB9OvXQ/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: It can be used by the government for surveillance quite easily
- Kavenna worries that, far from legislating to protect user privacy, US states will seek to access voice-assistant recordings in the name of crime prevention and national security. Last year, a judge in New Hampshire made headlines by ordering Amazon to submit Echo recordings of a double murder to investigators. “It puts them in a very complicated position between their customers and the government,” Kavenna says. “We’re very dependent on the political regime.” — [Updated on 2023-03-06 18:33:48](https://hyp.is/WFqcfrx3Ee2_Izvy_bgTIw/www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: This is similar to the ethos I spoke about in Encryption
