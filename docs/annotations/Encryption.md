## Page Notes
## Highlights
- It was a view that garnered much support in the public domain but which Apple’s CEO Tim Cook called a “potentially” chilling breach of privacy: “The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.” — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:22](https://hyp.is/pH596qjIEe2gfpM_Z9iFjA/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: The government wants to be able to access anything they want/need, whereas the tech CEO's want to withhold privacy as much as they can
- The next stage in the development of encryption may involve the use of quantum computers, which will add layers of complexity that are currently not possible. But until quantum cryptography becomes commonplace, there is a fear that this new groundbreaking technology could render current encryption next-to-useless. — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:23](https://hyp.is/pR49-KjIEe2RHvvlFrU8cw/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: What will happen when quantum computers become the norm? How will it effect the different encryption processes that would be then found useless affect day to day life?
- Cryptography is at the heart of all secure digital communications – the emails you send, the websites you visit (well, a growing proportion of them) and the apps you use. It allows for data to be scrambled and rendered unreadable by everyone except the intended recipient. — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:25](https://hyp.is/piGyZqjIEe26TZNKTyp7Iw/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows how much cryptography is involved in our day to day life
- On the morning of 2 December 2015, Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik shot and killed 14 people in the Californian city of San Bernardino. Approximately 20 others were injured. The attackers were tracked down later that day and in an ensuing gun battle were both killed. Determined to find answers regarding the killers’ motives, the FBI soon sought help from Apple to unlock an iPhone belonging to Farook. Apple, however, refused to comply. — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:26](https://hyp.is/pr-8LKjIEe2-bsMPT-m3Rg/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Brings into question the ethos of cryptography, should Apple have unlocked the phone for the FBI, or were they right to withheld that information?
- “The earliest known text containing components of cryptography originates in the Egyptian town Menet Khufu on the tomb of nobleman Khnumhotep II nearly 4,000 years ago.” — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:27](https://hyp.is/p66WvKjIEe21-1-NjKn82A/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Shows how long cryptography has been around and a part of human life
- he Spartans were also known to have developed a form of cryptography, based on wrapping parchment around a polygonal cylinder and Julius Caesar used a basic cypher to encode his messages – moving along the alphabet by a pre-agreed number of letters. — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:28](https://hyp.is/qFD6LqjIEe21_L8UOptO_Q/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Juias Ceasar's cipher is also used to this day
- the practice of cryptography actually goes back thousands of years. One of the earliest examples dates back to around 200 BCE and was devised by the Greek historian Polybius. In a Polybius square, letters fill out a grid of 25 spaces and each letter is identified by its coordinates in the square. — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:31](https://hyp.is/qc7TdqjIEe26KD9wS5eIbQ/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: This method is still very much used today
