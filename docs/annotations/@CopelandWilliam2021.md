## Page Notes
## Highlights
- This process is called public key encryption, and currently it leverages a few popular algorithms for key exchange, e.g., Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) or RSA (each named after cryptologists,) each of which are vulnerable to quantum computers. The data exchange has two steps: the key exchange and the encryption itself. The encryption of the data with a secure key will still be safe, but the delivery of the key to unlock that information (key distribution) will not be secure in the future quantum era.To be ready for quantum computers, we need to devise a new method of key distribution, a way to safely deliver the key from one end of the connection to the other. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 18:00:03](https://hyp.is/YjXYWtTGEe2C_8N7VKKmjA/www.verizon.com/about/news/quantum-computing-encryption-standards) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Although quantum computers are not smarter per say, they compute data much much faster, which renders cryptographic methods useless
- magine a scenario wherein you and a childhood friend want to share secrets, but can only do so once you each have the same secret passcode in front of you (and there are no phones.) One friend has to come up with a unique passcode, write it down on a piece of paper (while maintaining a copy for themselves,) and then walk it down the block so the other has the same passcode. Once you and your friend have the shared key, you can exchange secrets (encrypted data) that even a quantum computer cannot read. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 18:00:50](https://hyp.is/fniAJtTGEe2Ds3u-mAGBKA/www.verizon.com/about/news/quantum-computing-encryption-standards) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: basic level explanation of encryption
- In a world where global information transactions are happening nonstop, we need a safe way of delivering keys no matter the distance. Quantum physics can provide a way to securely deliver shared keys quicker and in larger volume, and, most importantly, immune to being intercepted. Using fiber optic cables (like the ones used by telecommunications companies,) special Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) equipment can send tiny particles (or light waves) called photons to each party in the exchange of data. The sequence of the photons encapsulates the identity of the key, a random sequence of 1’s and 0’s that only the intended recipients can receive to construct the key. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 18:02:33](https://hyp.is/u-JExNTGEe2wNlP205Vllg/www.verizon.com/about/news/quantum-computing-encryption-standards) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: A positive that quantum computers can bring in the world of encryption
- The other way we could choose to solve the security threats posed by quantum computers is to harness the power of algorithms. Although it’s true the RSA and ECDH algorithms are vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm on a suitable quantum computer, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working to develop replacement algorithms that will be safe from quantum computers as part of its post-quantum cryptography (PQC) efforts. Some are already in the process of being vetted, like ones called McEliece, Saber, Crystals-Kyber, and NTRU. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 18:05:16](https://hyp.is/HPBsvtTHEe29w793T2GC9g/www.verizon.com/about/news/quantum-computing-encryption-standards) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: We can use the flaws of cryptographic method to create more powerful and sustainable methods, which can withstand quantum computing
