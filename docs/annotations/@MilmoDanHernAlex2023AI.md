## Page Notes
## Highlights
- It boils down to this: most old-school computers do what they are told. They follow instructions given to them in the form of code. But if we want computers to solve more complex tasks, they need to do more than that. To be smarter, we are trying to train them how to learn in a way that imitates human behaviour. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:48:12](https://hyp.is/vUUWeLyBEe2uP1vfXoxO2g/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: high level definition of artificial evidence
- bout: Reinforcement learningPerhaps the most basic form of training there is, reinforcement learning involves giving feedback each time the system performs a task, so that it learns from doing things correctly. It can be a slow and expensive process, but for systems that interact with the real world, there is sometimes no better way. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:48:43](https://hyp.is/zz-66ryBEe258Jtmlj8-Yw/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Designed based off recieveing feedback for completing tasks
- Large-language modelsThis is one of the so-called neural networks. Large-language models are trained by pouring into them billions of words of everyday text, gathered from sources ranging from books to tweets and everything in between. The LLMs draw on all this material to predict words and sentences in certain sequences. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:48:56](https://hyp.is/1wSvBryBEe2gWt9K7oPbmA/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: modeled upon the human brain
- A chatbot draws on the AI we have just been looking at with the large-language models. A chatbot is trained on a vast amount of information culled from the internet. It responds to text prompts with conversational-style responses.The most famous example is ChatGPT. It has been developed by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based company backed by Microsoft. Launched as a simple website in November last year, it rapidly became a sensation, reaching more than 100 million users within two months. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:49:33](https://hyp.is/7UN2gLyBEe2b1Nser3Hu5g/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: ChatGPT is an example of a very complex AI chatbot
- The latest generation of chatbots, like ChatGPT, draw on astronomical amounts of material – pretty much the entire written output of humanity, or as much of it as their owners can acquire.Those systems then try to answer a deceptively simple question: given a piece of text, what comes next? — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:50:18](https://hyp.is/CAzb0ryCEe24XDPKqvEXfg/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: It uses the infinite resources of the internet as well as its power as a computer to generate answers to questions in a human-like manner
- What is deepfake? Deepfake is the term for a sophisticated hoax that that uses AI to create phoney images, particularly of people. There are some noticeable amateurish examples, such as a fake Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling on his soldiers to lay down their weapons last year, but there are eerily plausible ones, too. In 2021 a TikTok account called DeepTomCruise posted clips of a faux Tom Cruise playing golf and pratfalling around his house, created by AI. ITV has released a sketch show comprised of celebrity deepfakes, including Stormzy and Harry Kane, called Deep Fake Neighbour Wars. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:51:17](https://hyp.is/KwlqBryCEe2WLavqXe-Rkw/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: DeepFake is another highly dangerous method of artificial intelligence, that if developed to a certain level, can cause major problems in the world
- Experts fear a wave of disinformation and scams as the technology becomes more widely available. Potential frauds include personalised phishing emails – which attempt to trick users into handing over data such as login details – produced at mass scale, and impersonations of friends or relatives. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:51:52](https://hyp.is/QBAjkLyCEe23aGOHa6luNw/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: increase in fraud and scams is bound to increase as deepfake becomes more and more lifelike
- Will AI take our jobs?In the short term, some experts believe AI will enhance jobs rather than take them, although even now there are obvious impacts: an app called Otter has made transcription a difficult profession to sustain; Google Translate makes basic translation available to all. According to a study published this week, AI could slash the amount of time people spend on household chores and caring, with robots able to perform about 39% of domestic tasks within a decade. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 19:52:33](https://hyp.is/WHwYWLyCEe2ywycRtjMIFw/www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: eventually, computers will be able to complete the jobs of humans more efficiently, for less cost, which would reduce jobs
