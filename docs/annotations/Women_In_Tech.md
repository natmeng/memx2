## Page Notes
## Highlights
- *But Lovelace reconciled the competing poles of her parents’ influence. On January 5, 1841, she asked, “What is Imagination?” Two things, she thought. First, “the combining faculty,” which “seizes points in common, between subjects having no apparent connection,” and then, she wrote, “Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science.”* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:05](https://hyp.is/miitZqjIEe2g8T-Gx6QBFQ/www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Gives a brief insight on her mind and how she believed that imagination was the key to exploration and invention in the world of science
- *In the late seventies, the Department of Defense developed a software language called Ada—one that brought together a number of different programming languages.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:06](https://hyp.is/mrvsSKjIEe2W_f9WLkmywg/www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Ada receives some recognition for her outstanding achievements
- *In 1990, women held thirty-four per cent of STEM jobs; in 2011, it was twenty-seven per cent.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:07](https://hyp.is/m2tE1qjIEe2FCLOLjVg-_A/www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Even in today's age, tech is a very male-dominated field
- *Augusta Ada Lovelace is known as the first computer programmer, and, since 2009, she has been recognized annually on October 15th to highlight the often overlooked contributions of women to math and science.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:08](https://hyp.is/nBc0YqjIEe2b64-cw5vyyg/www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: I wonder how many other women there have been throughout history like Ada, who have achieved wonderful things in this field, but are diminished in history due to the fact that they are a woman
- *When Babbage began devising a new project, the “Analytical Engine”—sketched out as a hulking machine with thousands of cogwheels that could perform more functions with greater accuracy—Lovelace served as its key interpreter* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:09](https://hyp.is/nOmkTKjIEe2-U6urxhnHHw/www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Ada's first big break in the world of math and science
- *Years later, scholars would dispute that Lovelace actually wrote the notes. The Babbage historian Bruce Collier argued that her contribution had been greatly overstated, and “it is no exaggeration to say that she was a manic depressive with the most amazing delusions about her own talents, and a rather shallow understanding of Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine.”* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:11](https://hyp.is/ncVtOKjIEe2-Xc8IE3zkPA/www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Even later on people are still trying to diminish the work she accomplished
- *In order to keep that wealth and power in a man’s hands, there’s a backlash to try to redefine it as something a woman didn’t do, and shouldn’t do, and couldn’t do.* — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:12](https://hyp.is/nmZKoKjIEe2-VHOJfp-c9Q/www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: More of the same as mentioned previously
