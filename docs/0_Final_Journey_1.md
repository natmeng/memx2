The most powerful thing I learned in this course is the true untapped power of quantum computing. This journey shows how we got from the first computer in history to quantum computing today.

	-Ada gave birth to the concept of computing, as she worked as the key interpreter for Babbage's Analytical Engine, which was a machine with thousands of cogwheels, that perfomed functions with greater accuracy, which sounds very similar to what we know as a computer today.

		- The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer, built during World War II. At its time, it was considered the most powerful calculating device, and is considered the first-generation computer. However, this was not the only computational breakthrough that occured in WWII.....

		-  method in which one takes a simple message in plaintext, and uses a specific mode of cryptograpy, encrypts the plain text into ciphertext, which cannot be decrypted unless knowing the key needed to break the encryption. Although in the Germans had thought that its encryption methods were infinitely secure and impossible to crack, the Bletchley park team was still able to decrypt their codes and render their encryption laws useless. This sounds eerily familiar to the danger that this next topic poses in the future....

		- Major improvements in the quantum space, and more specifically quantum computing, has created a major threat to encryption methods used in e-commerce, and VPNs. This is due to the fact that the sheer power of quantum computers can be used to easily decipher and expose most, if not all of the common encryption techniques used in society today. So like the german enigma encryption, all common encryption techniques in society today can very quickly become useless.
