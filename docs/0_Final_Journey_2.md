At the tutorial level, I stated that *"I want to gain a deeper understanding of the internet, and computing, as a computer science major."* This journey shows how we I gained that throughout this course.

	-This article goes over the history of the internet and its invention, from its start as ARPANET to the internet today. The ARPANET was a model created by the US Defense Department in an attempt to integrate computing within the military's front lines.  As you can see, a lot of breakthroughs in technology have come due to wars and the military. This can be also said about advancements in computing as ...

		Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, a NASA laboratory in the South, in the mid-20th century during World War I, hired Black women as ‘computers’, which basically meant they were hired to do complex mathematical computations with nothing but graph paper and their brains. Whilst working at NASA, their women endured racism, segregation, and sexism, but continued to put the work in and demanded recognition.  This shows how at the very beginning of computing, it was still such a raw and new idea that it was still not a superior alternative to the human mind. However, as we are about to see, computing would become infinitely more powerful than the human mind and create loads of issues, such as.....

	- Artificial Intelligence, or AI; is a method in which we train computers to learn in a way that mimics how we learn as humans, then analyze information, and come to conclusions from patterns within datasets. As AI has developed throughout the years, it has very quickly, and easily surpassed the strength of the human mind, so much to the point that, in today's day and age, computers can create pieces of information so precise, that it is undetectable to the human eye that what they are looking at is a fabrication of reality, like .....

		- Deepfake, content using AI technology to mask the faces of people onto pictures/videos of other people. In the beginning, it was a harmless method in which people could poorly superimpose their faces onto pictures and videos in order to mess around with their friends. But now, due to such heavy advancements in technology, these deep fakes have become so powerful that even courts are now starting to have trouble differentiating a real video compared to a video using a deep fake.
