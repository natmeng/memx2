### Summary & Key Take Aways[¶](https://natmeng.github.io/memx2/sources/The_First_Computer/#summary-key-take-aways "Permanent link")
The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer, built during World War II in the United States by a team of  consisting of John Mauchly; a physicist, J.Presper Eckert Jr.; a engineer, as well as their fellow students at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Although its original intentions where to compute values for artillery-range tables, the ENIAC consited of some features that made it a very flexible machine, whic allowed it to execute different functionalites based off of data, which garnered it more useful for a largr subset of problems. It was a very large machine that conssted of hundreds of thousands of different parts, and costed $400,000 in government funcding. Its first task was to calculate for the construction of a hydrogen bomb. At its time, it was considered the most powerful calculating device, and is considered the first-generation computer.
