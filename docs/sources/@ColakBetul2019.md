Deepfakes are a rising security issue in security today. Throughout this article, the rise of deepfake content; content using AI technology to mask faces of people onto picture/videos of other people, is discussed. Although it was once just used to create deepfakes about celebrities, it is now widely accessible to the public,and it is very easy to create. This causes major issues, such as personal rights, intellectual property, and data protection. The World Intellectual Property Organization published a paper on specifically the issues of deepfake, and it suggests that if deepfake content is completely contradictory to the victim’s life, it should not be given copyright protection.
