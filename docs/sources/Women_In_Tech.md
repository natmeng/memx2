### Summary & Key Take Aways[¶](https://natmeng.github.io/memx2/sources/Women_In_Tech/#summary-key-take-aways "Permanent link")
Ada Lovelace is known as the first computer programmer, and is recognized every year on October 15th, as a nod to the vast involvment women have had in the evolution of computing and overall contributions in math and science. Ada opposed the ideologies of her fater Lord Byron, a poet, and her mother by believing that Imagination is "the combining faculty" that could "penetrate into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science". Ada meeting Charles Babbage, at the time a renowned mathmetician, would give her her first oppourtunity to break into this male-dominated craft, as Baggage would serve as her mentor, and Ada  worked as the key interpreter for Babbage's Analytical Engine, which was a machine with thousands of cogwheels, that perfomed functions with greater accuracy, which sounds very similar to what we know as a computer today.
