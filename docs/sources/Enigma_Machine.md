### Summary & Key Take Aways[¶](https://natmeng.github.io/memx2/sources/Enigma_Machine/#summary-key-take-aways "Permanent link")
The Enigma machine is an encryption device that was used to encrpt messages by the germans during World War II. It was a typewriter-like machine that operated in a facet that the machine took in a letter, and using three rotors, the mahine would change the inputed letter to a different output, with a reflector and plugboard. In order to break this message, one would have to be informed by the operator of the machine what the starting position and order of the rotors and the plugboard were if they were to have any chance at decoding the message. The enigma had a fatal flaw however, as no letter could ever be encoded as itself, so with this knowledge, the enemy could be able to potentially decipher common phrases and letters. This was subsequently fixed by the creation of the Lorenz, which was then followed by the Colossus, the world's first digitale programmable computer.
