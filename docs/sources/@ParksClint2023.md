Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, a NASA laboratory in the South, in the mid-20th century hired Black women as ‘computer’, which basically meant they were hired to do complex mathematical computations with nothing but graph paper and their brains. Whilst working at NASA, there women endured racism, segregation, and sexism, but continued to put the work in and demanded recognition. This article also delves into why World War 1 was a catalysit in these human ‘computers’ being hired. This story was also developed into the subject of the best-selling book and movie ‘Hidden Figures’.
