## Highlights
- After the war, Newman transferred parts of two Colossi from Bletchley Park to the University of Manchester, where he planned to create a peacetime centre for electronic computing. It was not long before Colossus’s successor, the first all-purpose electronic computer, was built in Newman’s Manchester computing laboratory. This new machine, called simply “Baby,” was the ancestor of today’s all-purpose computers. — [Updated on 2023-04-07 13:36:04](https://hyp.is/q-DenNVqEe28N_PW2WRUJQ/www.britannica.com/technology/Colossus-computer) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Parts of original colussus used
- The crux to decrypting a message was discovering the letters of key that the machine had used to encrypt it. Tunny messages were soon being broken by hand, using a method invented by mathematician Alan Turing for deducing the letters of key. Turing’s method was the code breakers’ only weapon against Tunny for many months, but hand breaking proved too slow to keep up with the increasing flood of encrypted messages, especially in the face of German enhancements to the security of the system. It became clear that high-speed analytic machines were required. — [Updated on 2023-04-07 13:37:26](https://hyp.is/3H_qttVqEe25sr9BFpSAnQ/www.britannica.com/technology/Colossus-computer) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Needed to decrypt german codes using machine instead of man power
- Colossus’s job was to strip a first layer of encryption from the German message. The result—still an encrypted message, called a “de-chi”—went immediately to the hand breakers, who stripped away the remaining encryption to reveal the German plaintext. — [Updated on 2023-04-07 13:37:41](https://hyp.is/5Ynl2tVqEe2y8ufRVsBT9Q/www.britannica.com/technology/Colossus-computer) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: First step in colussus's job
- Flowers said the Bletchley Park code breakers could hardly believe their eyes when they saw Colossus for the first time. Operating at 5,000 characters per second, it was soon analyzing over 100 messages a week. Not content to leave things there, Flowers used parallel processing in the Mark II Colossi to push up the speed to an incredible 25,000 characters per second — [Updated on 2023-04-07 13:38:19](https://hyp.is/_K35GNVqEe28OoPKKrnAWQ/www.britannica.com/technology/Colossus-computer) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: It would compute much faster than humans could ever do
