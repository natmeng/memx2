This article delves into the potential drastic security issues that are evolving through one of the most popular apps in the world right now; Tiktok. Cybersecurity experts in Australia believe that the app is being used by the chinese government in order to harvest sensitive data from its users, including personal information, messages with friends within the app, as well as device locations. In the article, the method in which Tiktok is harvesting its data is seen as overly excessive and not necessary, as no other social media apps use methods like this when harvesting data. ByteDance, a Chinese internet company that owns Tiktok, has stated that there is no connection between them and the chinese government, however, it is known that its staff in China has been able to acces Australian data through the app.
