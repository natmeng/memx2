On January 1st, California introduced a new Consumer Privacy act, which requires companies to inform its users what types of data they are collecting from them, as well as how the collected data will be used. This act also allows consumers to be able to opt out of their data being collected, as data privacy is a increasing  issue in society today.  This article talks about how this act could be a predecessor for a nationally imposed act that would financially affect a lot of big companies throughout the US, so  in response to this, big companies  like Microsoft have already begun to provide its users with the choice of whether or not they wan’t their data collected in an attempt to prevent the act from becoming national.
