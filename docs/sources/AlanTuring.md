**

This article goes through the complicated life of Alan Turing, a renowned English scientist who was known for being a key part of the bletchley park team in England that broke Germanys enigma code during WWII and saved millions of lives. Today, he is seen as the founding father of modern computing, however, as this article shows, while he was still alive, it was the opposite, as he lived a very troubled life. The timeline in this article begins at the very beginning of Turings life from being born in London all the way to being charged and found guilty of gross indecensy, which led to him committing suicide and taking his own life after being forced to take oestrogen suppliments rather than face jail time for his punisment. This article also dispells some common myths surrounding Turing’s work around Enigma, and takes note of his groundbreaking work, his early death, as well as the enourmous legacy he has left behind.
