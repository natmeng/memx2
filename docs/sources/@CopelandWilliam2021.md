**

Major improvements in the quantum space, and more specifically quantum computing, has created a major threat to encryption methods used in e-commerce, and VPNs. This is due to the fact that the sheer power of quantum computers can be used to easily decipher and expose most, if not all of the common encryption techniques used in society today. To prevent this, we must develop new protocols to securely deliver keys from one end of a connection to another. 2 leading candidates for this are QUantum key distribution, and Post-Quantum Cryptography
