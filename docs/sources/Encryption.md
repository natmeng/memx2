### Summary & Key Take Aways[¶](https://natmeng.github.io/memx2/sources/Encryption/#summary-key-take-aways "Permanent link")
This article goes over the history of cryptography, and how it is used today in the modern world. As we learnt in lecture, as well as in this article, cryptography is the method in which one takes a simple message in plaintext, and uses a specific mode of cryptograpy, encrypts the plain text into ciphertext, which cannot be decrypted unless knowing the key needed to break the encryption. This method has ties going back to ancient times, for example Julies Ceasar's ciper, and Polybius' square. In the modern world, cryptography is used to secure digital information and encryption. However, the ethos to cryptography is still clpuded, as mentioned in the article, after the san bernandino shooting in 2015, the FBI enlisted the help of Apple in order to unlock the assailants iPhone, which lead to a long-standing argument over the morality of this, as well as security.
