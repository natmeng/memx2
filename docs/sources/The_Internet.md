### Summary & Key Take Aways[¶](https://natmeng.github.io/memx2/sources/The_Internet/#summary-key-take-aways "Permanent link")
This article goes over the history of the internet and its invention, from its start as ARPANET, to the internet today. The ARPANET was a model created by the US Defense Department in an attempt to integrate computing within the militaries front lines. However, due to the mainframes on ARPANET not beinf mobile, they were not accessible anywhere in the world, which then became the next goal for the team of developers. This gave birth to the creation of a network that coudl transmit data to different branches of the military wirelessly by satelllite or radio. The final step was to link the ARPANET netwoek to the wireless network, which was solved by creating a common language that would allow the ARPANET to communicate with the wireless networks, which in result, created the "Internet"
