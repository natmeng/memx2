*The setting that governed these substitutions was known at Bletchley Park as the daily key, because it was usually changed every 24 hours. If the Bletchley Park codebreakers could work out the daily key, they could decrypt and read all of the intercepted German messages sent that day. This was done using replica Enigma machines, manufactured in Britain. But the number of possible daily keys was almost too big to imagine. In the case of the German army and air force Enigma, there were 158.9 million, million, million possibilities. It was this daily key that Turing and his colleagues were trying to work out. — [Updated on 2023-03-06 14:45:13](https://hyp.is/aXnjGLxXEe2m6Uv2d7PbKw/www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/alan-turing-life-death-legacy-facts-enigma-sexuality-timeline/) — Group: #Public*

With this in mind, why did the british government only task colossus with breaking the first round of encryption, then allow the human breakers to decrypt the rest? It would seem that it would have been more efficient to just let colossus do a full decryption
