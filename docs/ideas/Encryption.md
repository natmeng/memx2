- *The next stage in the development of encryption may involve the use of quantum computers, which will add layers of complexity that are currently not possible. But until quantum cryptography becomes commonplace, there is a fear that this new groundbreaking technology could render current encryption next-to-useless*. — [Updated on 2023-02-09 17:25:23](https://hyp.is/pR49-KjIEe2RHvvlFrU8cw/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/a-brief-history-of-cryptography-and-why-it-matters/) — Group: #Public

What will the effect of quantum computing be on day to life, as so much of the world around us is build on encryption?
