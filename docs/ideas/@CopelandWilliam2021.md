*This process is called public key encryption, and currently it leverages a few popular algorithms for key exchange, e.g., Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) or RSA (each named after cryptologists,) each of which are vulnerable to quantum computers. The data exchange has two steps: the key exchange and the encryption itself. The encryption of the data with a secure key will still be safe, but the delivery of the key to unlock that information (key distribution) will not be secure in the future quantum era.To be ready for quantum computers, we need to devise a new method of key distribution, a way to safely deliver the key from one end of the connection to the other. — [Updated on 2023-04-06 18:00:03](https://hyp.is/YjXYWtTGEe2C_8N7VKKmjA/www.verizon.com/about/news/quantum-computing-encryption-standards) — Group: #Public*

How long will it take for use to find a viable replacement for the current cryptographic methods in use? If a viable replacement cannot be found before quantum computing becomes strong enough to break these methods, hoq will this affect our national security?
