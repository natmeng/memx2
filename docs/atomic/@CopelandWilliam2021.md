-   Quantum computing is a growing phenomenon that surely will break all encryption technique used in ecommerce today, by using brute force to find keys in very fast time
    
-   We need to develop encryption techniques that are resistant to quantum computing
    
-   2(two) options are using physics and / or math
    
-   One option is to further strengthen current encryption techniques, like RSA, Shor’s algorithm, and TLS with quantum security
    
-   A second option is to  use already created post-quantum cryptographic methods, like McEliece,Sabe, or NTRU
